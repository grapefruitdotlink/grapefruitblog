The Grapefruit LMS is built to be intuitive and powerful. We have set out to design a system that instructors want to use. Instructors need a platform that helps them better communicate their concepts while not getting in the way. The thoughtless design practices seen across classic LMS systems all lead to an impersonal and dull learning experience. Our design challenge with Grapefruit is building a system that promotes a personal and connected learning experience, both in the physical classroom and online.


When talking about learning systems the first question anyone asks is “what features does system X or Y include?” Although the feature-set of a platform is important, making it the primary concern is problematic because it opens the discussion in a way that forever overlooks the importance of design quality. By immediately bringing up the number of features, the focus of the discussion is directed to quantity rather than quality. If we avoid this and focus the discussion on topics such as quality, usability, and effectiveness, and then translate the findings into a unified design, we can invent a much better platform. The idea is to create a platform that truly makes learning more effective.


Grapefruit currently works well; we have built a functioning platform that teachers already prefer to Blackboard. But the current platform is basically an open, functional, better looking version of Blackboard - this is not what we set out to make. Now that we have proved to instructors around the world that there is hope, we are now focusing on our grand vision. Grapefruit 2.0 is being designed from the ground up with learning and usability in mind. We have put aside our opinions and questioned all aspects of the platform. The new design carefully considers how instructors most effectively teach and takes an opinionated, powerful approach to enabling this interaction.


Designing Grapefruit has been an exercise of restraint; we are always considering any new idea’s effect on the simplicity of the greater system. We firmly believe that indiscriminately tacking on a popular feature without considering its impact on the platform’s user experience is dangerous. One may want to point this out as obvious, but in the current world of learning systems, feature-sets and customizability outsell effectiveness any day. Learning systems like Blackboard can technically do many functions, but because these functions are not unified with good design they are left untouched by most users.


Our opinionated approach may limit our potential users, but this is exactly what we want. To change education, we must start by collaborating and building with the most forward-thinking, driven teachers around the world - the teachers who are constantly looking for new ways to more effectively teach and inspire their students. Together as a community we can move to influence all educators and work towards the greater goal of instilling every person with the desire to learn and the the best tools possible to do so.
